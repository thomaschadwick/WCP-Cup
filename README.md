# WCP-Cup

An Ionic Hybrid app. Supports Android and iOS platforms. Uses Parse.com for the backend (requires parse keys added to the services.js file to use). I created this to create a simple Android and iOS interface to find out the upcoming matches, latest scores, and pool standings for the Regina WCP Cup. There are also jobs on the Kimono API platform that collect the tournament schedules and results. Background jobs running on Parse.com then bring in the data from Kimono to the database.
